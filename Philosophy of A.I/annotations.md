# Annotations for Philosophy of AI

I've never done this before for any of my college classes, but I'll try to keep notes of things while watching the lecture, if I get too distracted I'll review how to do this (maybe after the class, while reviewing the slides?)

In the first lecture (2022-02-09), the different lecturers/assistant professors are introducing each "sector" that will be discussed in the Philosophy of AI subject. I already have a writting assignment due to the 22nd of February, a big abstract of the first 6 chapters of 'The Cambridge Handbook for Artificial Intelligence'.

Unfortunately one of the lecturers had an issue, and had to leave before the end of the her introductory lecture, but with regards to the class in itself, I think this won't be a massive challenge, it will certainly be a test for my writing proficiency in English, and a review of how much I remember from all the A.I. minors I took at ESPM, but I didn't feel too confused with the topics presented.
