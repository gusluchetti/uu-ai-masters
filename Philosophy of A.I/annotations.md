I've never done this before for any classes, but I'll try to keep notes of things while watching the lecture, if I get too distracted I'll review how to do this (maybe after the class, while reviewing the slides?)

In the first lecture (2022-02-09), the different lecturers/assistant professors are introducing each "sector" that will be discussed in the Philosophy of AI subject. I already have a writting assignment due to the 22nd of February, a big abstract of the first 6 chapters of 'The Cambridge Handbook for Artificial Intelligence'.
