4 sentence paper on "Different Modelling Purposes"

They say that any model based on complex phenomena, namely, social phenomena, if not built with a specific purpose/role in mind, won't be able to yield any useful results.
I say that we definitely shouldn't expect models of that type to simply be a one-to-one solution to any social situation we attempt to predict with it, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't attempt to build a model that still functions properly with multiple purposes; this could possibly give way to new developments.
One might argue that given the difficulty and complexity in actually building viable multi-purpose models, without mentioning all of the information we still don't have with regards to our social responses, resources should not be used on unfruitful and unpredictable attempts.
I'd reply that these attempts might give us more insights on the missing pieces needed for a better documented and built "framework" for what a social model could be like.
