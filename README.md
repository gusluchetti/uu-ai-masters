This is an attempt to contain all of my written assigments and projects related to my time at Utrecht University!
As per the repo's title, my Masters' in Artificial Intelligence, and I started on Feb 2022.

My thesis proposal and writing will take place next year (2023), so I'll update the repo accordingly.

Note: Since some courses had big group projects with multiple contributors, I opted to add them as submodules instead of just adding them into the repository "manually".

    **Philosophy of A.I.**: Mandatory course with seminars every weeks where we discussed different fields of A.I. with a more phylosophical approach (who would've thunk?).

    **Methods in A.I. Research**: Mandatory course, seeks to introduce students to the field in a very superficial way. Students are then incentivized to look deeper into the subjects they enjoy the most. The course's main project involves building a restaurant recommendation dialogue system.
    
    **Data Mining**: It's data mining! Will update this later hehe.
